title: First post ever
resume: Hi there! As the title says clearly, this is the first time I write a post, so it's also the first time I have a blog. I hope you enjoy the content I'm going to throw in here.

<p>Most of the post (if not all of them) will be about coding. I'm a front end developer and it's being an amazing journey so far, so I'm planning to share with you the things I thing that can be useful to other developers.</p>
<p>See you around!</p>
