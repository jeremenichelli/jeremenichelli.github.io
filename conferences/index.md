resume: Organizing a conference is a lot of effort and time, thanks for your hard work and for taking me in consideration.

I want to make sure that your event and me are a good fit. I like taking part in conferences and events with:

- a **code of conduct** that says somewhere that everybody should be treated equally and with respect, no matter what.
- a **diverse speakers line up**, if you couldn't make it or it's not in your priorities then I prefer to pass and leave my spot for somebody else.
- all **travel expenses covered for each speakers** no matter their experiences or position in the industry, putting up a talk is a lot of effort and it's the least they deserve for that. 

_You check all these boxes? Awesome, [send me an email](mailto:jmenichelli@gmail.com) and let's make it happen!_
