<p>Through my career I've built different types of web products, from responsive and static generated sites to beautiful to animations and web applications.</p>

<p>My focus now is on component based web architecture, tooling and performance following the best practices in the industry.</p>

<p>These are some of the companies that trusted me...</p>

  {% include espn--logo.html %}
  {% include globallogic--logo.html %}
</div>

<p>I value open and honest communication above all. I feel comfortable both leading a project or developing the small pieces that make it work.</p>

<p>A lot of stuff I've made went to <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>StateFarm</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Disney</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong> domains and some of them got recognitions and <strong>awwwards</strong>.</p>
