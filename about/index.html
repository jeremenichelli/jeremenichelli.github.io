<p>I have experience building different types of web products, from responsive and static generated sites to beautiful interactive web applications.</p>

<p>My focus now is on creating these applications following the best practices and technologies in the industry, giving talks and writing technical articles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A person who adapts very quickly to new teams and new technologies</p>
  <ul>
    <li>German Vazquez, Project&nbsp;Manager</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Velocity Partners</strong>, <strong>Globant</strong>, <strong>Jam3</strong> and <strong>ESPN</strong> are some of the companies and agencies that trusted me through my career.</p>

<p>I feel comfortable both leading a project or developing the small pieces that make it work. I value open and honest communication above all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His human qualities and professionalism make him an excelent team member</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Juan Peralta, Regional&nbsp;Manager at Velocity&nbsp;Partners</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of my work went to <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Disney</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong> domains.</p>
