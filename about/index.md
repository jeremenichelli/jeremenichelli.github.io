His interest for web development started back when he opened a website for the first time as a child and asked himself why it was so slow.

> Cartoon Network website sucked back in the 90s

He is now an adult, or pretending to be one, and a self-taught front end engineer with a varied experience in different types of projects and workflows for web based solutions.

## Experience

He initially worked in content based web and marketing sites for companies like Microsoft, State Farm, Razorfish, NYSE and others.

Later, he helped build and maintain large applications for e-commerce companies and start ups based in the United States, with focus on test driven development and scalability.

> I met bundlers

Previous to his current position, he worked for [Jam3](https://jam3.com) agency building rich animated web experiences for clients like Pixar, Google, Oreo, Disney and Facebook, always _dangerously obsessed_ with performance and best practices.

> I made cookies fly and cars move, it was really fun

He is currently part of the Design System team at [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com) and he's a member of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) team. He enjoys [writing articles](/blog) and giving talks to share his learnings along the way.
