## Story and experience

After spending some time working on small sites for companies settled on my home town, I decided to make some changes, quit my job and leave university to become a self-taught front end developer.

That same year, **Globant** hired me and I had the chance to work with clients like Microsoft, StateFarm and NYSE on great responsive projects.

Later, I joined **OrderGroove** to build awesome scripts that power the subscription revolution with their team from New York.

I'm currently living in Montevideo, Uruguay working with the people from **Jam3**.

_I also write stuff on [Twitter][tw] and throw some code on [GitHub][gh]._

## About this site

Built with [Jekyll][1] and is hosted by [GitHub Pages][2] to work. Though it was developed from scratch, the design was heavily inspired by Heiswayi Nrird's [the plain theme][3].
