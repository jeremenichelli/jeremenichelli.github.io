## Experience

He initially worked in content based web and marketing sites for companies like Microsoft, State Farm, Razorfish, NYSE and others, with a focus on responsive design and accessibility.

Later, he helped build and maintain large applications for start ups based in the United States, with focus on scalability and test driven development.

> I met bundlers

Previous to his current position, he worked for [Jam3](https://jam3.com) agency building rich animated web experiences for clients like Pixar, Google, Oreo, Disney and Facebook, always _dangerously obsessed_ with performance and best practices.

> I made cookies fly and cars move, it was really fun
