# jeremenichelli.io

This is the repository which used to run my personal site, powered by GitHub Pages. I moved it all to [another repository](//github.com/jeremenichelli/personal-site) and using [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) as a static generator and [Netlify](//netlify.com) for hosting.
