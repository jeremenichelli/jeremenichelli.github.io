# jeremenichelli.io

This is the repository that runs ðŸ‘‰ (jeremenichelli.io)

## How it works

The site is generated by [Jekyll][1] and hosted by [GitHub Pages][2].

Scripts are bundle using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) and styles are processed with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) and [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) all using Node.js scripts.

### Local development

To locally run the page, in one tab of your favorite terminal run `jekyll serve`. This will generate the static files and run a server to access the site from the browser.

In another tab run `yarn start`, this will watch for changes in LESS and JavaScript files and generate styles and scripts needed on the critical rendering path and on page loaded.

This setup allows the site to not block rendering with any resource, even web fonts.

### Production

When all changes are in place, it is possible to run `yarn build` command to generate optimized styles and bundles ready for production. You can also run `yarn release`, this in addition to styles and bundles will generate new images and favicons.

_Feel free to report any issue or suggestion._
